### Why are you not promoted after 10 years ?

Best default answer (safe, mature, senior-level)</br>
“Promotions in my previous organization were strongly tied to scope and organizational needs rather than just years of experience.
For a long time, I was focused on being a strong individual contributor—delivering reliably, solving complex backend problems,
and owning critical services—but I didn’t actively position myself for the next level in terms of visible cross-team impact and leadership.
In the last year, after explicit feedback from my manager, I’ve been intentionally working on expanding my scope—driving design discussions,
mentoring engineers, and taking ownership of end-to-end systems. That’s also why I’m now looking for
roles where the expectations and growth path toward Staff are clearer and aligned with the impact I’m already capable of delivering.”

No blame, Shows reflection, Shows action, Shows ambition without entitlement
