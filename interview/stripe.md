Technical Evaluation

1. Coding & DSA
- Medium to hard problems aligned with backend systems
- Common areas: rate limiting, intervals, hashing, graphs, greedy, DP
- Emphasis on explaining correctness, trade-offs, and scalability

2. System Design
- Payment-centric designs (rate limiters, IAM, ledgers, transactions)
- Topics include sharding, replication, idempotency, fault tolerance
- Strong focus on design decisions and trade-offs

3. Debugging
- Identify and fix issues in production-like codebases
- Clear debugging approach, logging strategy, and validation methods

4. API Integration
- Build workflows using Stripe-style APIs (payments, invoices, subscriptions)
- Robust error handling, retries, and idempotent design expected

5. Behavioral
- Motivation for Stripe, ownership, collaboration, incident handling
- Structured answers using the STAR framework

6. Key Takeaway
- Stripe values engineers who think like product builders:
- Clean, production-quality code
- Strong backend and distributed systems fundamentals
- Clear, structured communication over unnecessary complexity
